# Programming in Science - Assignment 1

This template repository is the starter project for Programming in Science Assignment 1. Written in Python, and tested with Pytest.

### Question(s)

1. **(10%)** Using Python Built-in Functions:

   - Write a function that calculates the ```maximum``` of three input numbers using Python’s built-in functions.

2. **(10%)** Using Python Built-in Functions:

   - Write a function that calculates the ```minimum``` of three input numbers using Python’s built-in functions.

3. **(20%)** Conditional Statements – The ```If``` Statement:

   - Write a function that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero and returns a corresponding message.

4. **(20%)** For Loop – Making a Star Shape:

   - Write a function that prints a star shape with a given number of rows using a ```for``` loop. For example, if the input is 5, the output should look like this:

   ```
   *
   **
   ***
   ****
   *****
   ```

5. **(20%)** While Loop – Counting Multiples of 3:

   - Write a function that counts from 1 to 20 using a ```while``` loop. For every number that is a multiple of 3, the function should return "Multiple of 3" instead of the number.

6. **(20%)** Do-While Loop Simulation – Ask for Positive Number:

   - Write a function that continuously asks the user for a number until they input a positive number. The function should return the first positive number input by the user.
